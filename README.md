# FacadePersonalization_Fuzzylogic

As a case study, the following dataset is collected to control a modular adaptive facade based on the users' visual comfort preferences in a shared office space. The methodology includes two main stages: 1) pre-processing stage which consists of the hourly simulation dataset calculated by Ladybug-tools for visual comfort objectives (task illuminance, vertical eye illuminance, and view ratio), and 2) post-processing stage which takes the simulation dataset as inputs for the fuzzy logic application that allows personalizing the modular facade.

P.S.
Excel file names: M(x)P(x) - M stands for "Module", P stands for "Position"

Limitation: 
The dataset is collected for a certain adaptive facade design and occupants' positions and view directions which could not be applicable to other case studies.
